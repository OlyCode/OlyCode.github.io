WeakCrypt is a simple encryption program that uses an iterated SHA256 hash as a stream cypher, storing the result as a hex string. WeakCrypt's diminutive title refers to the fact that cryptography is easy to do wrong. You should use this product whenever a modest amount of easily implemented encryption is required.
